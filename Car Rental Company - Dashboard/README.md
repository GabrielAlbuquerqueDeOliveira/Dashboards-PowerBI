# Car Rental Dashboards

### Power BI Portfolio

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created for a fictional Brazilian car rental company. The project serves as a portfolio piece showcasing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design. Inside this repository, you will find the Power BI project file (`.pbix`) and a PDF version of the final dashboard.

### Key Metrics and Insights

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the company's performance by visualizing key metrics, including:

* **Total Rental Value:** The total revenue generated from car rentals.
* **Average Days in Advance:** The average number of days between booking and the start of the rental period.
* **Average Daily Rate:** The average price per day for a rented vehicle.
* **Average Rental Duration:** The average number of days for each rental contract.

### Data Aggregation & Analysis

The dashboard is interactive and allows users to explore the metrics at various levels of aggregation, providing deeper insights into the business. You can filter and view the data by:

* **City:** Analyze performance across different locations.
* **Month:** Identify seasonal trends and track performance over time.
* **Vehicle Type:** Compare the performance of different vehicle categories, such as `Economico`, `Intermediario`, `SUV`, and `Luxo`.

Power BI Dashboards Repository
Welcome! This repository serves as a portfolio of the dashboards I have created using Power BI. Here, you can find a collection of projects, each with its own dedicated folder containing the Power BI file and a README.md file that explains the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) steps and the process of building the visuals.
